This script applies the Borneo Bat Classifier (BBC) machine learning classifier to collated bat call parameter measurements from Borneo and assigns relevant labels
#### Data inputs required:
###### - WAV files in 5 second fragments (users)
###### - Machine learning models (available to download - "model_Type_1000.rds", "model_CF_1000.rds", "model_FMqCF_2000.rds")
###### - Confidence thresholds for each species (available to download - "ThresholdValues.csv")

#### The output includes: 
###### - Pulse measurements 
###### - Predicted class labels (call type/sonotype/species) 
###### - Confidence of class label - Script to locate files based on species & confidence on your desktop & reorder them for manual verification

#### Software used to create classifier
###### - R v3.6.3
###### - Kaleidoscope v5.1.9g (Wildlife Acoustics, 2019)
###### - Adobe Audition v12.1.5 (Adobe Creative Cloud)

#### Our aim is continuously test and update this tool as new reference data becomes available. Therefore, we would greatly appreciate users sharing any issues they find, particularly if this relates to species' IDs. Thank you!
